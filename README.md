# quizmaster
This is a simple little node websocket app that I made to play a simple quiz game with my friends and family. 

As the quizmaster: go to the app in your browser, and set up a game. Give the room code to your friends, and let them join. When they press the 
buzzer, you'll see who pressed first, and are able to distribute points on correct answers!

As a player: go to the app in your browser, and enter the room code of the game you want to join. Press the buzzer if you know the answer,
but you better have your answer ready! :)
